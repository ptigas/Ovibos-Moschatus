A couple of years ago, I returned home, a bit drunk, and started
randomly clicking on wikipedia articles. I ended reading about muskox.
My first response was surprise and excitement by it's severe ugliness.
Several years later, during my MSc studies, I attended Computational
Biology and part of this course was to do a project with an animal of
our choice, ask a question about it and answer using data. So, I decided
to choose "muskox" and the question to ask was, "where does all this
unglynens comes from?". The study is a bit technical but the answer very
interesting.
